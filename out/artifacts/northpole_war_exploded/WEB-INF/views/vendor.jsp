                Ah summertime. The warm weather, the long days, and the sweet sound of Pop Goes the Weasel coming from down the block. The ice cream truck has long been an American staple and Milwaukee is no exception.<br>
                North Pole Ice Cream has been providing vendors with excellent products since 2003. We offer a convenient one stop shop for all of your ice cream candy and beverage needs!<br>
                We are distributors of Blue Bunny ice cream novelties and also carry a wide variety of quality ice cream products. From bomb pop jr.'s for toddlers, batman, sonic, and bratz bars for children, cookies & cream cups or turtle sundae bars for mom and dad, we carry items to satisfy every taste and every age. We also have some of the best prices in the area.<br>
                If you want to sell ice cream year-round or just for a season we offer great resale prices and an excellent product line of Blue Bunny frozen treats. Resale accounts are easy to set up and you'll enjoy our fast, friendly service and competitive prices. These accounts are great for ice cream truck owners.<br>
